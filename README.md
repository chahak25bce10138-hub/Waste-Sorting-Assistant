# Waste-Sorting-Assistant
Hazardous waste refers to any waste material that poses a significant risk to human health or the environment because it is toxic, corrosive, flammable, or reactive. It is generated from households, industries, hospitals, laboratories, and agricultural activities. Common examples include batteries, chemicals, solvents, paints, pesticides, medical sharps, and electronic waste.
This type of waste is dangerous because it can contaminate soil, water, and air if not handled properly. Exposure to hazardous waste can cause serious health problems such as poisoning, respiratory issues, skin irritation, and long-term diseases. Therefore, hazardous waste must be carefully collected, stored, and disposed of through authorized facilities or recycling centers. Proper management helps protect the environment, reduces pollution, and ensures public safety.
People often throw waste items into the wrong bin, causing pollution and recycling failures. Many do not know whether specific items (e.g., batteries, plastic cups, tissues) are recyclable or hazardous.  A simple Python-based Intelligent Waste Sorting Assistant can guide users to correctly dispose of items by analyzing their description.
