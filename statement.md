1. Problem Statement

Improper waste disposal is a major environmental concern worldwide. Many people do not know which items are recyclable, organic, hazardous, or general waste, leading to pollution, health hazards, and inefficient recycling. There is a need for a simple, user-friendly tool that helps individuals correctly classify waste items and follow proper disposal practices.

The Intelligent Waste Sorting Assistant (IWSA) addresses this problem by providing instant guidance on how to dispose of everyday waste, encouraging sustainable behavior.

Classifying common household waste items into categories: Recyclable, Organic, Hazardous, General Waste, or Unknown.
Providing clear, practical disposal instructions.
Maintaining a summary of all items sorted during a session.
Serving as an educational tool to raise awareness about responsible waste management.
Potential extensions: GUI, voice input/output, or machine learning-based smart classification.
This project focuses on text-based interaction, suitable for beginners and educational purposes, while being scalable for future enhancements.

3. Target Users
